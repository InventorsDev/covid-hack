# `COVID-19 REPORT üåç`

## About

Globally, you'll need an internet connection to get latest report about the covid-19 pandemic, hence countries with no steady access to Internet connection has no means of getting steady updates.
<br>
We are breaching this gap integrating Twilio API to help people get latest info needed about the pandemic without having to be online.

### How it works
You'll only need to access the  web app once [here](https://inventorsdev.github.io), after which you'll get a pop-up asking for your mobile number.
And that's it, you'll be updated with covid report everyday.
(This process is automated using Cron job).
<br>
> Optionally, visiting the web app will automatically detect your location and help you get reported cases in your country + global cases only, so as not to bore you with big statistics data's.
<br>
The app also supports performing self test right on your device
